/**
 * Resolves the Cloudflare bindings (CMS_DB, CMS_ASSETS, …) in both runtimes the
 * CMS runs in:
 *
 *   - Worker  (`astro dev`, and the deployed Worker): bindings come from the
 *     `cloudflare:workers` module.
 *   - Plain Node (`cms:seed`, `cms:admin`, `cms:reindex`, and your own import /
 *     migration scripts run with `node --import tsx`): that module doesn't
 *     exist, so we fall back to wrangler's getPlatformProxy(), which exposes the
 *     SAME local D1/R2 that `astro dev` uses (from .wrangler/state).
 *
 * This is what lets the cms:* scripts (and custom scripts) talk to the local
 * database/storage from Node without being run inside the Worker.
